# Resources folder

App's strings.

'values' folder correspond to english version, used as default.

If you want to add a translation create a copy of the values folder named values-[country code] (example values-es) and translate the files inside.

Note: the countries.xml file can be very time-consuming to translate. If you remove that file from the locale folder, the english names will be used.
